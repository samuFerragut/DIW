# WHAT I HAVE TO DO?

Create the webpage you can see in this image with the same measures. The layout must have a width of 1000px  1050px. It doesn’t need to be responsive.
Here you have a full size capture of the final result

Page - General settings
The contents of the website must be centered according to the sides of the viewport
The page is divided into 7 parts, every part is separated by a dashed border 
Font must be Verdana and sized 13px for all the website
Use the  tool to capture the colors of the layout (you can find it in Firefox, f.i)
Write the styles in an external style sheet ,  inserting  id  and  class  in the HTML5 code when needed

The styles and measures that are not indicated in the following lines, must be created as similar as possible to the image

### 1) Header
Set the logo image using background-image property 
“The Computer School” is an h1 and its font is double size of the body font size	
### 2) Menu
Create the sections of the menu using an unordered list modified (`<ul> <li>`).  Tip: https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_navbar.asp
Every section of the menu has:
A font size 30% bigger than the body font
Vertical padding of 10px 
Horizontal padding of 20px
### 3) Pattern
Use the background-image and the image available in images to create this pattern
### 4) Central image
Use `<img>` to insert the image
Use the image available in images
The image must have exactly the same proportions and look as in here (Use the layout properties we’ve seen in class make it look exactly like that)
### 5) The Grades
The table must be exactly as it appears
### 6) Angular, HTML, PHP, Javascript
Use the tag `<img>` to insert the four images. 
The images must be horizontally centered
The texts under the images have a 20px size and are bold
On the left and on the right of every image there’s a single border of 1px
### 7) Footer
Use only one `<div>`, two  `<span>`  and make use of 
 to put one text on the top left corner and the other text on the bottom right corner
### 8) Validate the HTML5 document
You must always validate your ’HTML5 andl CSS3. You can use the extension V3C Validation for  VSC	


Remember that the exercices are not mandatory but I strongly advise you to do them in order to practice, as any of them they can appear in the Trimestral Exam
